            My site focuses on bringing all the news to one place, where I am showing how I have partnered with the
            news,
            and blogging websites to showcase their news on my page. This meant taking the material of articles with the
            same genre and bringing them to this one platform. This will save time for people on the go and visit
            different
            websites to read the news of their choice. The structure is pretty simple, I have used flex as a display
            mode
            and have tried to keep things minimalistic as possible by leaving large spaces and showing less content in a
            large area. Whereas I have made cards to display the news on every page, while the structure remains the
            same on
            all the pages.
            While using flexbox enabled the site to be responsive and it can be viewed at any screen, either a phone,
            tablet or a laptop.

        <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
        <li>
            <p>
                I like things to be minimalistic, easy to use, and navigate soo this is one of the reasons why the
                design of the
                website is like it is
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                While learning more about the structure of the website I stumbled upon this video tutorial making a
                clean and
                minimalistic page, which I liked and wanted to make something like that(Link will be given in the
                resources
                section)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Another inspiration was these minimalistic websites which made me want to create something similar to it
                which
                will visually be easy to digest and appealing. Websites such as Jazz FM, Maaemo, and We ain't plastic.

        <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have added images with 'Alt' texts, this will help people with visual impairments to be able to hear
                the
                picture description using screen readers
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have not used tables because it is hard for screen readers to read out the content from the table
                which will
                cause a problem for impaired people
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I haven't used really low contrast colors for the text, although I have used a lot of gray but text has
                a color
                that will be easily visible for people with some color blindness.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Usability:</h2>
        <li>
            <p>
                The site is visually minimalistic, with no flashy pictures, colors, and design that will bug the user.
                It uses
                simple colors like gray, white, and black to make sure it is aesthetically appealing to people of every
                age
                group
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

                The minimalistic nature of the site makes it easier to navigate through different pages and view
                content. The
                navigation bar is nicely spaced and even on smaller screens the visibility is not an issue. Also the
                website is responsive, so, hence can be viewed at any screen size. Which makes it more versatile and
                better for the user. For this, I used media selectors and flexbox to make it responsive.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The navigation points are also given on the footer as well soo it makes it easier to navigate when the
                user
                comes down the page which makes it, even more, easier to go to the next page.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <p class="p">
            Now, coming on to the things I learned before making the website. I had made the wireframes but I had weak
            knowledge of the structure and design basics, soo I had to learn those before starting. After learning the
            basics of design, the next thing was designing a site using flex design and using a media selector to make
            the
            site responsive. Now, I watched several youtube videos for this, and found inspiration from many designs,
            and
            found out how to use 100 view height and 100 view width in different width and height selectors. I learned
            how
            to make cards from different websites and seeing different designs and codes on the internet. In the end, I
            replicated the work I found in a youtube video which I felt was well-fitted for my code and design. Also, I
            learned a lot of javascript functions and methods of selecting the class and updating it for my animation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
        Next time around, I'll work on the photo slider, even more, to make it more visually appealing and add another
        feature to manually select the photos. I would like to add a reading area, where rather than going to a certain
        website, readers can read the articles on the website. This would mean, that I would be having a standard HTML
        page which the articles will lead to display the content. Another thing that I would like to add will be the
        dark mode, which can be toggled upon the user's preference.
    </div>


    <p class="p">
        As far as the resources are concerned, I have used youtube as my main source of code which I will be linking
        below. Most code is slightly changed then the original for some cases it's not which will be mentioned in the
        code too.
