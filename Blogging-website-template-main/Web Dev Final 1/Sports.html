                <h3>How Mbappe's non-transfer shows where football power lies</h3>
                <p>The deal that didn't happen best defines the landscape of European football after a summer transfer
                    window that saw unexpected moves by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
                    Kylian Mbappe will remain with Paris Saint-Germain this season, and the star French forward could
                    leave for Real Madrid as a free agent at age 23 next summer for free rather than for a fee that
                    could have exceeded $200 million now.</p>

                    at the Pinnacle Fall Series.
                    The Swedish veteran was in a one-vs-four post-plant situation on Nuke, sitting in the vents—a

                <h3>What is tap-strafing in Apex Legends?</h3>
                <p>As one of the battle royale’s more advanced mechanics, tap-strafing allows mouse and keyboard players
                    to pull off quick maneuvers and change directions rapidly. But controller players can’t replicate
                    it, prompting Respawn to level the playing field. Since Respawn announced that tap-strafing will be
                    removed in Patch 10.1, the Apex community has been divided over the issue.</p>
