                <h3>Netflix’s ‘Blood Brothers: Malcolm X & Muhammad Ali’: Film Review</h3>
                <p>The interviewees in Blood Brothers: Malcolm X & Muhammad Ali generously use words like “destiny,”
                    “fate” and “prophecy” to describe the friendship between the two iconic civil rights activists at
                    the center of this documentary. At first the words, a testament to the influence and deep meaning of
                    the pair’s connection, sound beautiful. But as the film unfolds, meandering through their respective
                    biographies before, with great speed, chronicling their three-year friendship, the nouns start to
                    ring hollow. </p>

                    Energy’</h3>
                <p> Are you ready to ‘say yes’ to new music from MxPx? The punk band’s frontman Mike Herrera shares why
                    he’s ‘excited’ to share the upbeat song, the work behind their livestream shows, and more.
                    Even though Mike Herrera has been happily married for twenty years, the MxPx frontman is feeling
                    some teenage jitters when he talks with HollywoodLife, as if he’s back in high school and about to
                    tap someone on the shoulder to see if they’re free to hang out on Friday night. </p>

                <p>The upcoming superhero installment was trending on Twitter as some accounts shared what appeared to
                    be the trailer while others tried to predict the consequences the alleged leaker might face.

                    Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Star Tom Holland, seemingly referring to
                    news of the leak, posted the message “You Ain’t Ready!”
                    Some links to the alleged trailer were taken down and slapped with a copyright statement. “The media
                    has been disabled in response to a report from the copyright owner,” the message read.</p>

                <h3>Neill Blomkamp Unsure If He'd Ever Return To Alien 5</h3>
                <p>Writer/director Neill Blomkamp opens up about his uncertainty of returning to make Alien 5 should the
                    opportunity present itself in the future. The project first began development in 2015 when the
                    District 9 filmmaker began sharing concept art for a potential film, including works featuring
                    Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley and Michael Biehn's Dwayne Hicks, before ultimately confirming that
                    the film would be a direct sequel to Aliens with Weaver and Biehn expected to return. Blomkamp also
                    confirmed he was developing more than one film for Fox's franchise after the film, which was
                    reportedly titled Alien: Awakening.</p>

                <h3>Spider-Man Will Fight The Multiverse Sinister Six In No Way Home - Theory Explained</h3>
                <p>Spider-Man: No Way Home will explore the multiverse and the chaos it can bring to the Marvel
                    Cinematic Universe a bit deeper, opening the doors to various threats, which has made fans believe
                    Spider-Man will fight the multiverse Sinister Six. The first three phases of the MCU, collectively
                    known as the Infinity Saga, were all about Thanos’ quest to get the Infinity Stones, mount them on
                    the Infinity Gauntlet, and wipe out half of life in the universe, but now that this arc is over, the
                    MCU is moving forward with a different and bigger issue. So far, Phase 4 has established the
                    multiverse and its potential madness as the main theme, and Spider-Man: No Way Home will delve into
                    it.</p>

                <h3>
                    Why Venom: Let There Be Carnage Is Rated PG-13
                </h3>
                <p>When the first Venom movie was in production there were a lot of fans wondering, and hoping, that the
                    film could end up with an R-rating. The character was capable of extreme violence and so it was
                    possible, if the movie decided to show that violence, that the movie could end up being made for
                    mature audiences only. In the end, the movie came out with a PG-13 rating, and considering how well
                    the movie did at the box office, that was probably the right call. And so it's little surprise that
                    sequel Venom: Let There Be Carnage has now been officially given a PG-13 rating as well, but now we
                    know why

                <p>It's time to resurrect. Nearly 20 years after The Matrix Revolutions, the world of The Matrix returns
                    with December's The Matrix Resurrections, which will see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising
                    their roles as Neo and Trinity, respectively. Also starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Priyanka Chopra
                    Jonas, Neil Patrick Harris, and Jonathan Groff in undisclosed supporting roles, Lana Wachowski's new
                    movie is shadowed in mystery, though we're learning more about this forthcoming film as we get
                    closer to its winter release date. With that said, here's what we currently know about this fourth
                    Matrix film.</p>

                    Timothée Chalamet Compares Dune To Harry Potter
                </h3>
                <p>The highly anticipated reboot of Dune is steadily approaching, and Timothée Chalamet may have just
                    psyched up a whole different fandom for the movie in just a sentence or two. The star makes a bold,
                    but super logical, leap in comparing his upcoming film to the Harry Potter franchise, which on the
                    surface only really are similar because they are both world building fantasy series.
                    While the demographic of Frank Herbert’s Dune and JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series started out as
                    for different demographics and have completely different aesthetics about them, Timothée Chalamet
                    expertly compares the two in an interview with Deadline. </p>

                    Meanwhile, the release date fo the full double album, ‘Fever Dreams Pts 1-4’, is to be announced.
                    The record will be Marr’s first since 2018’s ‘Call The Comet‘.
                    Speaking about the new single, Marr said: “’Spirit, Power And Soul’ is a kind of mission statement.
                    I had an idea about an electro sound with gospel feeling, in my own words… an electro soul anthem.”

                    To celebrate 25 years since the release of their debut album, Spice Girls will be releasing a deluxe

                    ‘Believe What I Say’. Whether we need it or not, the rapper is the king of unpredictability, as
                    characterised in the lead up to the much drawn-out release of ‘DONDA’. In the works since at least
                    March 2020, the album was originally meant to be released 13 months ago and has in the last few
                    weeks seemed on the verge of arriving, only to not materialise. Over the course of that
                    will-he-or-won’t-he period, the star has held listening parties that have seen him levitate high up

                <p>At this point in our digitally dependent lives, we all know the horror that a life lived through
                    screens can hold. We’ve been abused by trolls on the internet, and had our perceptions of ourselves
                    warped by filters and our peers curating their own existences to look perfect, leaving out any hint
                    of mundanity or bleakness. We’ve read the sensationalised headlines about video games driving good
                    people to do bad things, or how increasingly gory horror movies are desensitising us to real-world
                    violence. After taking all that in, would you want to listen to an album that’s based around those
                    very things?</p>

                <h3>Julia Bardo: Manchester-via-Italy songwriter finding her creative home in the North</h3>
                <p>The meaning of home can be much more complex than being a single physical space. It can be a memory,
                    a person, a place, a feeling. One thing is for sure, though: for better or worse, home is tied to
                    our own sense of identity, and on Julia Bardo’s debut album ‘Bauhaus, L’Appartamento’ the
                    singer/songwriter wrestles with her own sense of self.
                    Bardo’s story starts in northern Italy, where she grew up facing the common conundrum of living in a
                    rural village: the idyllic scenes of nature surrounding you on all sides juxtapose with the
                    mundanity of having relatively little to do.</p>
