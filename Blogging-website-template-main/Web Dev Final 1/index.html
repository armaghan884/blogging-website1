                <h3>Moeen Ali named England vice-captain for fourth Test against India at The Kia Oval</h3>
                <p>Moeen Ali to be Joe Root's vice-captain in fourth Test against India with Jos Buttler missing the
                    match at The Kia Oval due to his wife expecting their second child; five-match series is tied at 1-1
                    following England's innings win at Emerald Headingley
                    The off-spinning all-rounder will be Joe Root's deputy with wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler missing
                    the game at The Kia Oval from Thursday due.....</p>

                <h3>Pollo Asado with Confetti Cauli-Rice </h3>
                <p>This simple Pollo Asado recipe is my version of the traditional Mexican / Cuban slow-cooked chicken
                    dish, marinated in lots of lime & orange juice, & seasoned with spices such as cumin, coriander,
                    turmeric, paprika, and chili powder.
                    What I love about this recipe is how versatile it is – I've served it here with my Confetti
                    Cauli-Rice, though it would also be delicious in a taco using organic corn tortillas or as a protein
                    on a taco salad, with rice & beans, or with sautéed plantains.</p>

                <h3>Friberg wins 1-vs-4 clutch for Dignitas on Nuke</h3>
                <p>Dignitas’ in-game leader and former Ninjas in Pyjamas player Adam Friberg showed a glimpse of his
                    2013 form—the year he made it onto HLTV’s top 20 CS:GO players in the world list—today against LDLC
                    at the Pinnacle Fall Series.
                    The Swedish veteran was in a one-vs-four post-plant situation on Nuke, sitting in the vents—a
                    position designed to kill players rotating from the A bombsite</p>

                <h3>Netflix’s ‘Blood Brothers: Malcolm X & Muhammad Ali’: Film Review</h3>
                <p>The interviewees in Blood Brothers: Malcolm X & Muhammad Ali generously use words like “destiny,”
                    “fate” and “prophecy” to describe the friendship between the two iconic civil rights activists at
                    the center of this documentary. At first the words, a testament to the influence and deep meaning of
                    the pair’s connection, sound beautiful. But as the film unfolds, meandering through their respective
                    biographies before, with great speed, chronicling their three-year friendship, the nouns start to
                    ring hollow. </p>

                <h3>Afghanistan: UK and Taliban in talks over further evacuations</h3>
                <p>The talks, involving UK officials and senior Taliban members, are taking place in Doha, Qatar, No 10
                    said.
                    The defence secretary is understood to have told MPs that between 150 and 250 people eligible for
                    relocation - plus their families - remain in the country.
                    It comes after a Taliban pledge to allow further departures.
                    Commenting on the UK-Taliban negotiations, a No 10 spokesman said: "The prime minister's special
                    representative for Afghan transition, Sir Simon Gass, has travelled to Doha and is meeting with
                    senior Taliban representatives to underline the importance of safe passage out of Afghanistan for
                    British nationals..... </p>
