                <h3>Pope inadvertently quotes Putin to chide West's Afghan war</h3>
                <p>Pope Francis has criticized the West's recent involvement in Afghanistan as an outsider's attempt to
                    impose democracy — although he did it by citing Russia's Vladimir Putin while thinking he was
                    quoting Germany's Angela Merkel.
                    Asked during a radio interview aired Wednesday about the new political map taking shape in
                    Afghanistan after the United States and its allies withdrew from the Taliban-controlled country
                    after 20 years of war, the pope said he would answer with a quote that he attributed to the German
                    chancellor, whom he described as "one of the world's greatest political figures."</p>

                <h3>Afghanistan: UK and Taliban in talks over further evacuations</h3>
                <p>The talks, involving UK officials and senior Taliban members, are taking place in Doha, Qatar, No 10
                    said.
                    The defence secretary is understood to have told MPs that between 150 and 250 people eligible for
                    relocation - plus their families - remain in the country.
                    It comes after a Taliban pledge to allow further departures.
                    Commenting on the UK-Taliban negotiations, a No 10 spokesman said: "The prime minister's special
                    representative for Afghan transition, Sir Simon Gass, has travelled to Doha and is meeting with
                    senior Taliban representatives to underline the importance of safe passage out of Afghanistan for
                    British nationals..... </p>

                <p>A number of stunning entries to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition have been released,
                    including images of an Iberian lynx framed in a doorway, cheetahs swimming in a raging river and
                    blood dripping from the muzzle of a lioness.
                    There were a record number of entries to the 57th edition of the competition, which is organized by
                    the Natural History Museum in London, and a selection of "highly commended" images was released
                    Tuesday evening.
                    "It was the overall quality of entries that took us by surprise," said Roz Kidman Cox, chair of the
                    judging panel, in a press release.</p>

                <h3>China's 'revolution' cost investors $3 trillion. So why aren't they running scared?</h3>
                <p>Heavyweight global investment firms are sticking with China despite a sweeping crackdown on business
                    by the ruling Communist Party that has wiped $3 trillion off the market value of the country's
                    biggest companies.
                    Even as authorities rip up the status quo for tech, education and other private enterprise, drawing
                    comparisons with Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution in the process, some of the biggest names in asset
                    management say it's still a good time to invest. They say recent regulatory moves were necessary and
                    overdue, and China's growth story remained attractive.</p>

                <h3>Sarah Rainsford: My last despatch before Russian expulsion</h3>
                <p>After more than 20 years reporting from Moscow, I still can't believe it.
                    I suspected I was being singled out around a year ago when the Russian foreign ministry started
                    issuing me short-term visas. Even those would be approved at the last minute.
                    At one point I was told I'd been given my last-ever visa, before the official claimed she'd been
                    mistaken.
                    But on 10 August I was taken aside at passport control at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport and told I'd
                    been barred from Russia by the FSB security service. The officer reading out the order had all the
                    words, but no explanation.
                    "Sarah Elizabeth," - he kept using my middle name.....</p>

                <h3>Stocks mixed to kick off September</h3>
                <p>U.S. stock indexes were mixed Wednesday as the major averages looked to kick off September with
                    gains.
                    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10 points, or 0.03%, while the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq
                    Composite index jumped 0.18% and 0.43%, respectively. The choppy trade comes after all three of the
                    major averages gained in August with the S&P extending its monthly winning streak to seven. The ADP
                    jobs report showed private payrolls last month added 374,000 workers, missing the 613,000 that
                    analysts were expecting. The report sets the stage for Friday’s jobs report. In stocks, Robinhood

                <h3>International Space Station facing irreparable failures, Russia warns</h3>
                <p>The International Space Station (ISS) could suffer "irreparable" failures due to outdated equipment
                    and hardware, a Russian official has warned.
                    At least 80 percent of in-flight systems on the Russian segment of the ISS had passed their expiry
                    date, Vladimir Solovyov told state media.
                    He also said small cracks had been discovered that could worsen over time.
                    Russia has often raised concerns over hardware and has suggested it could leave the ISS after 2025.
                    The station was built in 1998 as part of a joint project between Russia, America, Canada, Japan and
                    several European countries and was originally designed for a 15-year lifespan. </p>

                <p>A police car crashed in northern France after an officer in the passenger seat fired her Taser in the
                    direction of the driver, prosecutors say
                    Six officers were in the vehicle when the driver lost control and hit a parked car in Roubaix, near
                    Lille, on Saturday.
                    The police car left the scene without stopping, prosecutors said. There were no reports of injuries.
                    Three officers, including the one who discharged the Taser, are in custody.
                    The incident happened while the officers were en route to Roubaix after finishing their shifts,

                <h3>Biden’s affordable housing plan doesn’t address how supply will be brought to market: Real estate
                    expert</h3>
                <p>The White House is opening up "Pandora’s box" with its new plan to address the housing crunch,
                    according to one Real estate expert.
                    Romer Debbas LLP managing partner Pierre Debbas told "Mornings with Maria" the president’s plan
                    doesn’t really address housing supply and its impact on the real estate market.
                    "A number of matters that they outlined this morning really doesn't address: how are you going to
                    bring supply to the marketplace?" Debbas told FOX Business' Dagen McDowell.
                    The U.S. housing market is 3.8 million homes shy of meeting demand, researchers at Freddie Mac
                    estimate. </p>

                <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., forcefully came out against the nomination of former Chicago
                    Mayor Rahm Emanuel to be the next U.S. ambassador to Japan, calling the selection "deeply shameful."
                    Ocasio-Cortez pointed to Emanuel's response to the 2014 police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan
                    McDonald, which resulted in a $5 million settlement with McDonald's family and the second-degree
                    murder conviction of former police officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot McDonald 16 times. Other
                    officers had said in reports that McDonald posed a threat at the time of the shooting, but police
                    video footage indicated otherwise.</p>

                <h3>Fox News Poll: High concern over higher prices</h3>
                <p>oter concern over inflation remains sky high, as more voters blame higher prices on the pandemic than
                    on the government. At the same time, over half rate their family finances positively -- and far
                    fewer are looking for help from Uncle Sam than last year.
                    That’s according to the latest Fox News survey released Wednesday.
                    Nearly half, 47 percent, say the message they would like to give the federal government is "leave me
                    alone," up from 36 percent a year ago. On the other side, 44 percent say they would tell the
                    government "lend me a hand." That’s down significantly from 57 percent who felt that way last
                    August. </p>

                    The much-anticipated gathering could have high-stakes implications for Zelensky, who has vied for
                    American support since he took over in 2019. His ascension to office led to a congratulatory call
                    from then-President Donald Trump, who pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.</p>
