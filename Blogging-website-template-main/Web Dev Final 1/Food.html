                <h3>Pollo Asado with Confetti Cauli-Rice </h3>
                <p>This simple Pollo Asado recipe is my version of the traditional Mexican / Cuban slow-cooked chicken
                    dish, marinated in lots of lime & orange juice, & seasoned with spices such as cumin, coriander,
                    turmeric, paprika, and chili powder.
                    What I love about this recipe is how versatile it is – I've served it here with my Confetti
                    Cauli-Rice, though it would also be delicious in a taco using organic corn tortillas or as a protein
                    on a taco salad, with rice & beans, or with sautéed plantains.</p>

                <h3>HA Simple, Sparkly Summer Pound Cake</h3>
                <p>Crunching through the snow in Tasmania on the cusp of spring, Thalia Ho looked down and saw a layer
                    of green peeking through the ice. Her first thought: I shouldn’t have worn Doc Martens. Her second:
                    Basil granita.
                    But several recipe tests in, she’d abandoned first the granita (the basil’s fragrance was muted) and
                    then an herby cake (“the delicacy was just ruined in the heat”), settling instead on a sparkling
                    basil sugar piled atop a buttery loaf. </p>

                <h3>Vegan Strawberry Cake (GF)</h3>
                <p>This strawberry cake is pure magic. One bite and it shot us straight back to childhood memories of
                    eating hot pink cake at birthday parties. It’s not only fresh and vibrant with strawberry flavor,
                    but also incredibly fluffy and sweet, and each bite is like a flavor explosion in the mouth. We’re
                    talking rainbows and unicorns and happiness on a plate. Whoa.
                    Plus, top with our Vegan Strawberry Buttercream Frosting (infused with real, ripe strawberries), and
                    you’ll be in pure bliss!</p>

                <h3>Apple Pie Overnight Oats</h3>
                <p>Friends, we have another sumptuous overnight oat recipe for you, this time apple pie inspired! We are
                    both oat and apple obsessed, so the combination of the two was inevitable. This simple, 9-ingredient
                    recipe is perfect for fall and meal prep for busy mornings. We went for cooked apples to really
                    highlight a pie-like texture. And it’s naturally sweetened to keep things on the wholesome side. Let
                    us show you how it’s done!</p>

                <h3>Tagliatelle With Corn, Tomatoes, "Onion-Bacon" & Basil </h3>
                <p>Over the years, we've made this pasta with shrimp, with bacon, and with both shrimp and bacon, and,
                    when the tomatoes and corn are at peak sweetness, it practically shouts summer. Which is to say,
                    it's easy, fresh, and hist notes that you can get only a few weeks a year. I worried about making an
                    entirely plant-based version of it....</p>

                <h3>Keto Chicken Tenders</h3>
                <p>This easy at-home chicken tender recipe will soon become your favorite option for lunch or dinner.
                    Perfectly crispy without using conventional breadcrumbs, and keto-friendly, to boot!

                    I recommend making a double-batch; you'll find yourself eating leftovers for days – reheat them in
                    the oven or toaster oven for the best texture.</p>

                <h3>Charred Serrano White Bean Dip</h3>
                <p>Dreams do come true! We had an idea for a charred pepper and white bean dip, but we never imagined it
                    would turn out this good. Trust us when we say this is going to be your new favorite savory, spicy,
                    creamy, lemony, oh-so-versatile dip.

                    It’s the perfect companion for veggies, wraps, flatbread, naan, and beyond. Just 8 ingredients and
                    30 minutes required. Let us show you how it’s done! </p>

                <p>We’ve been wanting to crack the code on vegan, gluten-free flatbread for a while now, so we were
                    thrilled when we finally stuck the landing.
                    This bread is perfectly fluffy, light, and flavorful, and preparation is about as simple as it gets:

                    The whole process happens in 1 bowl in ~20 minutes. Fresh, fluffy gluten-free bread perfect for
                    wraps, dips, snacking, and more! Let us show you how it’s done.</p>

                <h3>Mini Mediterranean Kebabs (Kofta)</h3>
                <p>In this recipe for Mini Mediterranean Kebabs, the bold flavors of Mediterranean food are paired with
                    a cooling tzatziki sauce. Featuring Balanced Bites GREEK spice blend, the savory flavors contrast
                    nicely with the bright, creamy sauce—it’s an amazing combination.

                    This easy appetizer recipe is perfect to bring to a party or can be made without the cocktail sticks
                    for an easy weeknight dinner</p>

                <h3>Extraordinary Marinated and Roasted Chicken, Potatoes, and Chickpeas </h3>
                <p>After its stint in the oven, the marinade cooks down to this incredible, sticky savoriness around the
                    potatoes and chicken. And when combined with the crispy bits of chickpeas, tender chicken, and
                    marinade-sodden potatoes, it's heaven on a plate. This is adapted from Elaine Boddy's "Lebanese
                    Inspired Potatoes and Chickpeas" from her lovely blog "foodbod." —Selma | Selma's Table</p>

                <h3>Classic Chicken Piccata </h3>
                <p>The flavor of this recipe was absolutely delicious, with a tart pucker from all the lemon and capers
                    that's balanced by a last-minute addition of butter and the fresh brightness of parsley. The
                    shallots get melty as they cook down, making for a sauce that's perfect on its own with the angel
                    hair and even better when you add the chicken</p>

                <h3>Creamy Asparagus, Lemon, and Walnut Pasta</h3>
                <p>This is a perfect Sunday evening supper for spring, and makes the most of seasonal asparagus. The
                    lemon keeps things fresh and zesty, while the walnuts contribute the “crunch” factor. The dish takes
                    a mere 15 minutes to make, so you have no excuse not to! It’s so delicious, you’ll want to double
                    the recipe so you have leftovers.</p>
